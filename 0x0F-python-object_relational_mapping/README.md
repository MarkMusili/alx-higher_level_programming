# Object Relational Mapping Project
The project is divided into two parts:
1. Using a low-level module (mysqldb) that provides a DB-API for me to interact with my data base.

2. Using a higher level library (MySQLAlchemy) which is ORM that provides more abstraction and lets me use python logic to interact with my database.
